Name something specific William J. Clinton (aka Slick Willie) actually accomplished? -- other than hiding subpoenaed documents, Pardoning Crooks (Marc Rich [payoff to Clinton coffers] and other various Hillarys Radical Friends) and the opening of immigration floodgates to millions of illegal aliens.   Clinton is also responsible along with Carter and now Obama in Federalizing much of the Western Lands allowing Radical Environmentalists to get rich while depriving the Country of much needed Energy Independence, that has also led to us financing our enemies who want to destroy us.
